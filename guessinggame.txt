# As a quick note at the outset, I was unable to really figure out how to incorporate a function into my program. I'm using the zsh shell, which appears to have a process for creating commands that is different than that outlined in the textbook. If you have any feedback on that, it would be greatly appreciated.

files=$(ls|wc -w)
echo "How many files are in the current directory?"
read response
if [[ $response -eq $files ]]
then
   echo "Nice, you got it the first time!"
   echo "See you later!"
fi
if [[ $response -ne $files ]]
then
   while [[ $response -ne $files ]]
   do
      if [[ $response -lt $files ]]
      then
         echo "Incorrect! Your guess was too low."
	 echo "Try again!"
         read response
      elif [[ $response -gt $files ]]
      then
         echo "Incorrect! Your guess as too high."
         echo "Try again!"
         read response
      else
         echo "Correct, you finally got it!"
      fi
  done
if [[ $response -eq $files ]]
then
   echo "Correct, you win!"
   echo "See you later!"
fi
